## Getting and cleaning project assignment

In this project we read the human activity recognition data using Samsung phone,
and create a tidy data. 

In addition to the README.md file, there are 
three more scripts in this repository:

CodeBook.md, run_analysis.R, and tidy_data.txt

* CodeBook.md: 
The data and analysis steps are described in the CodeBook file.
* run_analysis.R:
The main code that clean the downloaded raw data and creates the tidy version.
* tidy_data.txt:
The final output of the project (with the link in github as well)
     
**please Note:** 
The reshape2 library and a correct path is required to run the R code.
